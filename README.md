Pipeline for clustering and predicting patient outcomes

DTW: performs independent or depedent dynamic time warping on mutlidimensional time series data,
producing a final distance matrix that is used for clustering.

Clustering: implements UMAP dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering to cluster a distance matrix.
Three cluster validity indexes are implemented to internally validate the results.

Note:
The data is not uploaded since access to the MIMIC-IV 2.0 data is restricted for credentialed users for which CITI Data or Specimens Only Research is required and a data use agreement is signed. The researcher must complete a course in protecting human research participants. Researchers can apply for access to the data by following the instructions on this page: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.0/#files-panel.
